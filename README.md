# Number-Recognition
The simple implementation of image detection using OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) python library to print the accuracy of detecting 
the numbers in a given image [Range: 0 to 9]. 

# Accuracy
Currently the accuracy rests at 93.47% for a static image.

# Process
The step by step process is explained below for one to understand the code design.
